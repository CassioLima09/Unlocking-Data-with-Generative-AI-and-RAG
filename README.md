**Enhance generative AI systems by integrating internal data with large language models using RAG**

## What is this book about?
Generative AI is helping organizations tap into their data in new ways, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combining the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with internal data for more intelligent and relevant AI applications. The author harnesses his decade of ML experience in this book to equip you with the strategic insights and technical expertise needed when using RAG to drive transformative outcomes.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand RAG principles and their significance in generative AI
* Integrate LLMs with internal data for enhanced operations
* Master vectorization, vector databases, and vector search techniques
* Develop skills in prompt engineering specific to RAG and design for precise AI responses
* Familiarize yourself with AI agentsâ€™ roles in facilitating sophisticated RAG applications
* Overcome scalability, data quality, and integration issues
* Discover strategies for optimizing data retrieval and AI interpretability
